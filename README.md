# Bank-security-system2
 Security is primary need for every person whether it just comes to physical 
things or digital data.  Banks are one of those places where security plays a 
major role. Banks hold financial resources and sensitive information. Physical 
security, such as having individuals monitor the bank premises, is one way to 
ensure safety. Additionally, other methods can be employed that do not rely on 
human surveillance.
 This project aims to provide a means of safeguarding the bank from theft 
without the need for direct human supervision. The project utilizes a laser and 
infrared sensor to detect the presence of any objects or individuals in the 
vicinity of the bank and triggers an alert by sounding a buzzer whenever an 
intrusion is detected.
